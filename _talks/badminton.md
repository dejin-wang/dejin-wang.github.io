I am a **badminton holic**. Outside my academic and research life, badminton has become one of the most important parts of my routine. I regularly play singles and doubles.

I have been playing badminton for three years, and I also participate in badminton competitions. These are some of the medals I have earned:

The sport gives me a unique balance of speed, strategy, and focus. It keeps me active, clears my mind after long coding or research sessions, and brings a sense of rhythm and competitiveness into my daily life.

Badminton has become more than a hobby—it keeps me energized and grounded, and it always reminds me to stay sharp, disciplined, and joyful in both sports and research.
