I am a **dragon boat paddler**. Dragon boat paddling has become an important part of my athletic routine. It combines strength, endurance, teamwork, and rhythm in a way that no other sport does.

I have been paddling for one year, previously training and competing with the **Nankaitianda Nantianmen Dragon Boat Team** and the **Boston Storm Dragon Boat Team**. I have already participated in several dragon boat races, each offering unforgettable experiences and challenges.

Dragon boat paddling gives me a unique balance of physical power and collective synchronization. It keeps me disciplined, helps me clear my mind after long research hours, and strengthens both my body and determination.

The sport has become more than just training—it keeps me energized, grounded, and inspired, reminding me of the importance of teamwork, persistence, and passion in both sports and research.
