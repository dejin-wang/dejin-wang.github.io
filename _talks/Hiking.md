I love **hiking**. Outside my academic and research life, hiking has become one of the most refreshing and grounding parts of my routine. Whether it is a quiet forest trail or a steep mountain climb, spending time in nature always brings me clarity and calmness.

I hike regularly on weekends or during short breaks. Being outdoors helps me reset after long research hours and gives me space to think, observe, and appreciate the world at a different pace.

Here are some hiking moments I captured:

Hiking gives me a sense of freedom and exploration. It helps me stay physically active while also offering mental space to reflect, decompress, and reconnect with myself. It has become a meaningful part of my life, balancing both my research and personal well-being.
